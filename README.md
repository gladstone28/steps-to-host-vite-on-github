QUESTION: Can you kindly remind me of the steps to host my vite react application on Github pages?

ChatGPT said: To host your Vite React application on GitHub Pages, follow these steps:

#### 1. Create a Repository on GitHub
- Go to GitHub and create a new repository. Name it appropriately (e.g., my-vite-react-app).
- You can initialize it with a README.md file if you'd like.

#### 2. Set Up Your Project for Deployment
Ensure you have already created a Vite React app using npm create vite@latest. If not, run the following in your terminal:

```
npm create vite@latest my-vite-react-app
cd my-vite-react-app
npm install

```
#### 3. Install gh-pages Package
Install the gh-pages package to easily deploy to GitHub Pages:
```
npm install gh-pages --save-dev
```
4. Update vite.config.js
You need to update your vite.config.js to set the base URL for GitHub Pages. If your repository is named my-vite-react-app, your config will look like this:

Open vite.config.js and modify it to include the base property:
```

export default {
  base: '/my-vite-react-app/',  // Add your repository name here
  // other config options
}

```
#### 5. Modify package.json Scripts
In your package.json file, update the scripts to include deploy commands. Modify the scripts section as follows:
```

"scripts": {
  "dev": "vite",
  "build": "vite build",
  "predeploy": "npm run build",
  "deploy": "gh-pages -d dist"
}
```
#### 6. Build and Deploy
Now, you can deploy your application using the following commands:

```
npm run deploy
```
This will:

- Build the project.
- Deploy the contents of the dist folder to the gh-pages branch of your repository.

#### 7. Enable GitHub Pages in Repository Settings

- Go to your GitHub repository.
- Click on Settings.
- Scroll down to the Pages section.
- Select the gh-pages branch as the source for GitHub Pages.
- Save the settings.

#### 8. Access Your Application
After a few minutes, your application will be live. You can access it using the following URL:

```
https://<your-username>.github.io/<your-repository-name>/

```
If you've followed these steps correctly, your Vite React app should now be live on GitHub Pages!
